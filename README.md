This repo is my colletion of C++ experiments.

1. [Parentheses](#1-parentheses)
2. [Combined numbers](#2-combined-numbers)

## 1. Parentheses

[Source code](src/1-parentheses)<br>
**Description**<br>
Write a program to determine if the parentheses `( )`, square brackets `[ ]`, and curly braces `{ }` in a string **are balanced**. Balanced means each opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of brackets are properly nested. For example:

* `{{)(}}` is **not** balanced because `)` comes before `(`
* `({)}` is **not** balanced because `{`  precedes `)`
* `[({})]` is balanced
* `{}([])` is balanced
* `{()}[[{}]]` is balanced
* `{(([]))]((` is **not** balanced as the last two parentheses are not closed
